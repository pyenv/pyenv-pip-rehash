**Since Pyenv v20141211, this plugin's functionality is present in the core Pyenv so this plugin is no longer needed.**

# pyenv-pip-rehash

## Installation

### Installing as a pyenv plugin

Make sure you have pyenv 0.2.0 or later, then run:

    git clone https://github.com/yyuu/pyenv-pip-rehash.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-pip-rehash


### Installing with Homebrew (for OS X users)

Mac OS X users can install pyenv-pip-rehash with the
[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) package manager.

*This is the recommended method of installation if you installed pyenv
 with Homebrew.*

```
$ brew install homebrew/boneyard/pyenv-pip-rehash
```

Or, if you would like to install the latest development release:

```
$ brew install --HEAD homebrew/boneyard/pyenv-pip-rehash
```

## Usage

1. `pip install` a pip that provides executables.
2. Marvel at how you no longer need to type `pyenv rehash`.

## How It Works

pyenv-pip-rehash hooks every invokation of `pip` commands via `pyenv`.
If the first argument for `pip` is `install` or `uninstall`, it invokes `pyenv rehash` automatically.
